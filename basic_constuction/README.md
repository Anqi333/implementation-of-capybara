This is a simple implementation of Capybara to evaluate its cost. This repository includes implementation of Capybara with instantiations based on Schnorr and ECDSA signatures.

## Requirements:

1. Python >= 3.7.3
2. bitcoin-utils

## Usage:

1. execute test_ecdsa.py to get the performance of Capybara based on ECDSA signatures
2. execute test_schnorr.py to get the performance of Capybara based on Schnorr signatures
